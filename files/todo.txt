TODOs:

LocalContext: addFunction to update LocalContext so users don't unintentionally update color or numOfIter

SideBar:
	Number with slider: On sidebar, tie range with number https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44182411/range-slider-with-direct-number-input
	Reset button: On sidebar, add reset button (input type="reset")
	Nested names: On sidebar, add <fieldset> and <legend> to have nested option names.

Settings:
	Remove ShapeSettings: adds unnecessary length and doesn't really make anything simpler. Would allow ShapeObjectSettings to be renamed as well.
	Setting Methods: Consider adding methods to Setting to replace current optional properties.
	Better Weights: Currently all shapes return a static weight. Could introduce settings that allow you to pick on a number functions that change the weight contextually, like based on numOfIter.

Split:
	Memoize splitFactors: Maybe make splitFactors memoized as well or instead of allFactors.
	Improve SplitContext: Investigate better structure for SplitContext

Indent:		
	Perhaps allow bool that allows indenting without drawing for
		for the purpose of special indenting.
	Try adding to special.
	Also possibly incorporate variable indenting amount.

Random:
	Seeded: Add new seeded random generator

Color:
	OKLAB: add OKLAB color support
		Has code conversion example: https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/
	Percentage change: maybe do percentage increases instead too.

Hosting:
	Custom hosting: buy webpage and host there.
